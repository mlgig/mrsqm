# MrSQM: Fast Time Series Classification with Symbolic Representations

MrSQM (Multiple Representations Sequence Miner) is a time series classifier. The 
MrSQM method can quickly extract features from multiple symbolic representations of time series and train a linear classification model with logistic regression. The method has four variants with four different feature selection strategies:

  * MrSQM-R: Random feature selection.
  * MrSQM-RS: MrSQM-R with a follow-up Chi2 test to filter less important features.
  * MrSQM-S: Pruning the all-subsequence feature space with a Chi2 bound and selecting the optimal set of top *k* subsequences.
  * MrSQM-SR: Random sampling of the features from the output of MrSQM-S.

## Example

Load data from arff files
```
X_train,y_train = util.load_from_arff_to_dataframe("data/Coffee/Coffee_TRAIN.arff")
X_test,y_test = util.load_from_arff_to_dataframe("data/Coffee/Coffee_TEST.arff")
```
Train with MrSQM
```
clf = MrSQMClassifier(nsax=0, nsfa=5)
clf.fit(X_train,y_train)
```

Make predictions
```
predicted = clf.predict(X_test)
```

*** If you are struggling to install mrsqm from source because of fftw3 you could also consider the [newsfa](https://github.com/mlgig/mrsqm/tree/newsfa) branch. The implementation in this branch uses [SFAFast](https://www.aeon-toolkit.org/en/stable/api_reference/auto_generated/aeon.transformations.collection.dictionary_based.SFAFast.html#aeon.transformations.collection.dictionary_based.SFAFast) instead of C++ SFA so it depends on aeon instead of fftw3. However, experiments on the UCR and UEA archive have shown that this version of mrsqm is a bit slower and less accurate than the main one. ***
